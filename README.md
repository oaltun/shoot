# Shoot

A game/simulation engine that lacks by design.

This engine is intended for being a starting code in a Computer Graphics/Game Programming course.

Students should add to it and use it.

Tested only on Chrome.

Features:

- Game objects and Game Object hierarchy
- Rudimentary collision detection
- Explicit WebGL operations in GameObjects

Uses Angel and Schreiner's MV.js. As such complements their WebGL book well.
